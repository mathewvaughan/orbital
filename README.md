## Rubric

- I want to build a rest API using FastAPI
- I will try not to use a database because this is a read only app and it will save time
- Order of imnplementation of features:
    - Handle list endpoint
    - Handle pagination
    - Handle detail endpoint
    - Handle ordering by ID
    - Handle desc and asc ordering
    - Handle ordering by title_number
    - Handle filtering by title_class
- TODO:
    - Add more tests data
    - determine response structure for pagination
    - paginate
    - add detail endpoint
    - handle missing id because why not


- I will try to use libraries to do the heavy lifting, because this would be a lot of work to do from scratch
